- std::function has performance loss compared to a functor created directly
- std::function prevents inline optimizations, that which the compiler can optimize with lambdas.
- Dynamically allocated memory for captured variables:
--for std::functions assigned to lambdas with captures, heap based memory is used to capture the captures.
Memory costs, along with cache misses which comes with heap-based allocation.
-std::function is just a wrapper around functions and lambdas so we can be flexible and assign one to another.
-std::function is NOT a lambda, not a function pointer.
